# GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist ✅

Your portfolio is **ready to deploy**! Follow this checklist:

## ✅ Pre-Deployment (Already Done)

- ✅ Production build tested successfully (7 pages generated)
- ✅ RSS feed configured and working
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow ready (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file added to prevent Jekyll processing
- ✅ Static output configured in `astro.config.mjs`
- ✅ All responsive issues fixed
- ✅ Dark mode, navigation, and all features working

## 🔧 Before You Push (Required)

### 1. Update Your GitHub Username

Edit `astro.config.mjs` (line 9):

```javascript
site: 'https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io',
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

**If deploying to a repository** (not `username.github.io`):
- Uncomment line 12 and set: `base: '/portfolio-v4'` (or your repo name)

### 2. Update Contact Information

Update these files with your actual information:

- `src/data/contact.json` - Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Phone
- `src/data/about.json` - Bio and stats
- `src/data/skills.json` - Your skills
- `src/data/experiences.json` - Work experience
- `src/data/certifications.json` - Certifications

### 3. Add Your Assets (Optional but Recommended)

- Add `public/profile.jpg` - Your profile photo
- Add `public/resume.pdf` - Your resume/CV
- Update favicon if desired (currently has "OD" initials)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git if not already done

# Add remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-v4.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
