## Overview

Built a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.

### Key Features

- Feature engineering from customer transaction data
- Ensemble ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- SHAP values for model interpretability
- Real-time scoring API

### Technical Stack

- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Modeling**: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **API**: FastAPI for model serving

### Results

- **92% accuracy** in predicting churn
- **85% precision** for high-risk customers
- Reduced churn rate by **18%** after implementation
- Identified top 5 churn indicators

### Implementation

The model processes customer behavioral data including:
- Transaction frequency and recency
- Support ticket history
- Product usage patterns
- Demographic information

Deployed as a REST API that provides real-time churn probability scores for any customer.
