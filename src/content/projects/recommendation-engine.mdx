## Overview

Built a hybrid recommendation engine that combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning to provide personalized product recommendations.

### Key Features

- Hybrid recommendation approach
- Real-time personalization
- Cold-start problem handling
- A/B testing framework
- Diversity and serendipity optimization

### Technical Stack

- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow Recommenders
- **Algorithms**: Matrix Factorization, Neural Collaborative Filtering
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Redis
- **Serving**: TensorFlow Serving, AWS SageMaker

### Results

- **28% increase** in click-through rate
- **35% boost** in conversion rate
- **22% improvement** in average order value
- Reduced bounce rate by **15%**

### Implementation

The system uses a three-tier approach:

**Collaborative Filtering**
- Matrix factorization for user-item interactions
- Neural networks for complex pattern learning

**Content-Based Filtering**
- Product attribute similarity
- Category and brand affinity

**Deep Learning**
- Neural Collaborative Filtering
- Wide & Deep networks
- Attention mechanisms for context

Features include:
- Session-based recommendations for anonymous users
- Multi-armed bandit for exploration vs exploitation
- Real-time model updates with online learning
- Contextual awareness (time, device, location)

Processes 50M+ events daily and serves recommendations with sub-100ms latency.
