## Overview

Developed a comprehensive credit risk assessment system that evaluates loan applications and predicts default probability using advanced machine learning techniques.

### Key Features

- Multi-model ensemble approach
- Feature importance analysis
- Risk score calibration
- Regulatory compliance (Basel III)
- What-if scenario analysis

### Technical Stack

- **ML Models**: XGBoost, CatBoost, Neural Networks
- **Feature Engineering**: Feature-engine, Category Encoders
- **Model Monitoring**: MLflow, Evidently AI
- **Deployment**: Docker, FastAPI, Redis

### Results

- **87% AUC-ROC** score on test dataset
- **40% reduction** in bad loan approvals
- **15% increase** in approval rate for good customers
- Compliant with regulatory requirements

### Implementation

The model incorporates:
- Traditional credit bureau data
- Alternative data sources (payment history, employment)
- Behavioral features from application process
- Economic indicators and market conditions

Features advanced techniques:
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Monotonic constraints for interpretability
- Calibrated probability scores
- Fairness metrics to prevent bias

Integrated with loan origination system for real-time decisioning with explainable AI outputs.
