## Overview

Developed an interactive sales forecasting dashboard that combines time series analysis with machine learning to predict future sales trends.

### Key Features

- Automated time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- Interactive visualizations with drill-down capabilities
- Seasonality and trend decomposition
- Multi-region and multi-product forecasting
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns

### Technical Stack

- **Analysis**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Forecasting**: Prophet, ARIMA, TensorFlow
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Plotly Dash
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

### Results

- **94% forecast accuracy** for monthly sales
- Improved inventory planning by **25%**
- Reduced stockouts by **30%**
- Identified seasonal patterns across 15 product categories

### Implementation

The dashboard processes historical sales data and generates forecasts using:
- Facebook Prophet for trend and seasonality
- LSTM neural networks for complex patterns
- ARIMA for baseline predictions
- Ensemble methods for final forecasts

Updated daily with new sales data and provides 30-day rolling forecasts with confidence intervals.
