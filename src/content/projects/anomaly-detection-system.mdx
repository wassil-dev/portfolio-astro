## Overview

Developed an intelligent anomaly detection system that monitors network traffic patterns and identifies suspicious activities in real-time using unsupervised machine learning.

### Key Features

- Real-time streaming analysis
- Unsupervised learning (no labeled data needed)
- Adaptive thresholds
- Multi-level anomaly scoring
- Automated incident response

### Technical Stack

- **ML Algorithms**: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, One-Class SVM
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

### Results

- **96% detection rate** for known attacks
- **78% detection rate** for zero-day threats
- **Less than 2% false positive** rate
- Reduced mean time to detect (MTTD) by **65%**

### Implementation

Multi-layered detection approach:

**Statistical Methods**
- Z-score analysis for traffic volume
- Time series decomposition
- Moving average comparisons

**Machine Learning**
- Isolation Forest for outlier detection
- One-Class SVM for boundary learning
- DBSCAN for clustering analysis

**Deep Learning**
- LSTM Autoencoders for sequence anomalies
- Variational Autoencoders for reconstruction error
- Attention mechanisms for feature importance

Key capabilities:
- Learns normal behavior patterns automatically
- Adapts to network changes over time
- Provides explainable anomaly scores
- Integrates with SIEM systems

Monitors 100+ network devices and processes 1M+ events per minute with sub-second detection latency.
