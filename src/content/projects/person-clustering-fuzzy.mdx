## Overview

An entity resolution system that identifies and clusters duplicate person records across large datasets. Handles real-world data variations including typos, date errors, and location changes.

### Technical Stack

- **Fuzzy Matching**: Metaphone encoding, Jaro-Winkler distance, Token Sort Ratio
- **Graph Algorithms**: Connected components for transitive clustering
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Python**: Core implementation

### Pipeline Steps

**1. Preprocessing**
- Normalize names and standardize locations
- Parse dates with multiple format support

**2. Blocking Strategy**
- Group candidates by phonetic encoding + birth year (±1)
- Reduces comparisons from O(n²) to O(n)

**3. Fuzzy Matching**
- Name similarity (50% weight): Token Sort Ratio + Jaro-Winkler
- Date similarity (35% weight): Graduated scoring
- Location similarity (15% weight): Fuzzy string matching
- Threshold: 0.75 for match classification

**4. Graph Clustering**
- Build similarity graph from matched pairs
- Find connected components for transitive closure

### Performance

On 50,000 records:
- Total runtime: ~70 seconds
- Blocking reduces comparisons by 99%+ (1.25B → 250K pairs)
